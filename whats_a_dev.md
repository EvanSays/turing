## 👨‍🎤 Intro
Hi, im Evan Miller, an alum from 1703 FE. At that time we worked on our own personal projects in the 4th inning. I made a [magic mirror](https://github.com/EvanSays/magic-mirror). I think it was vexed, it was stolen in '20. Currently, I work for a company named [Cerebral](https://cerebral.com/). Our mission to democratize access to high-quality mental health care for all. It's been a ride for the past 2.5 years. As a senior mobile developer at Cerebral ive had a number of projects that I am proud of working on. From automating our release process, collecting data to proactively stomp bugs, and sharing code across platforms. Outside of work, im a husband and rock climber who lives in NOVA, Virginia.
