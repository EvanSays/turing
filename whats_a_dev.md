## üë®‚Äçüé§ Intro
Hi, im Evan Miller, an alum from 1703 FE. At that time we worked on our own personal projects in the 4th inning. I made a [magic mirror](https://github.com/EvanSays/magic-mirror). I think it was vexed, it was stolen in '20. Currently, I am working for a company named [Cerebral](https://cerebral.com/). Our mission to democratize access to high-quality mental health care for all. It's been a ride for the past 2.5 years. As a senior mobile developer at Cerebral ive had a number of projects that I am proud of working on. From automating our release process, collecting data to proactively stomp bugs, and sharing code across platforms. Outside of work, im a husband and rock climber who lives in NOVA, Virginia.

## üôÄ Mock Interview

#### Group Prompting Questions
1. What do you already know about tech interviews?
2. What would you like to learn about tech interviews

Let's try a mock interview together. I'll be the interviewer and one of you will be the interviewee. We'll also need a time keeper to call "Time Out" every few minutes so that we can get meta and discuss what's going well, what suggestions we have, and what we learn that we can apply to our own interviews. We also need a note taker to keep track of "aha" moments summarize takeaways for the group.
